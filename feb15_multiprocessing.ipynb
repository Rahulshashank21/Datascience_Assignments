    "Multiprocessing in Python is a module that enables the execution of multiple processes simultaneously. It allows the execution of separate processes, each with its own memory space and resources, to perform tasks in parallel. Each process runs independently and can communicate with other processes using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms such as pipes, queues, and shared memory.\n",
