To identify the peak travel season, we can analyze the date and destination features. We can group flights by month or quarter to identify the months or quarters with the highest number of flights or the highest average flight prices. We can also analyze flight prices by destination to identify any seasonal trends. We can present our findings to our boss using tables, charts or graphs to highlight the peak travel season and the reasons behind it.",

To identify trends in flight prices, we can analyze the date, destination, airline, and duration features. We can group flights by date or by month to identify any seasonal trends in flight prices. We can also analyze flight prices by destination to identify any price variations due to demand or supply. We can compare the prices of different airlines to identify any competitive pricing strategies. Additionally, we can analyze the relationship between the duration of flights and the prices to identify any pricing patterns based on flight duration. We can present our findings to the team using line charts, scatter plots, or heatmaps to visualize the trends in flight prices.\n\nQ8. You are a data scientist working for an airline company, and you have been asked to analyze the Flight Price dataset to identify the factors that affect flight prices. What features would you analyze to identify these factors, and how would you present your findings to the management team?\n\nA8. To identify the factors that affect flight prices, we can analyze the date, destination, airline, duration, and class features. We can analyze the relationships between these features and the flight prices using statistical methods such as regression analysis or correlation analysis. We can also use data visualization techniques such as scatter plots or heatmaps to visualize the relationships between the features and flight prices. Additionally, we can perform feature selection or feature engineering to identify the most important features that affect flight prices. We can present our findings to the management team using reports, dashboards, or presentations with clear explanations and visualizations of the factors affecting flight prices. We can also provide recommendations for pricing strategies based on our analysis.",
